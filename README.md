# Smart-Farming-Fertilizer-Prediction 	
-> System is designed to be used by farmers for suggestion of fertilizers to be used based on a set of soil features e.g. soil moisture, Ca, Potassium, soil pH etc. The prediction model is supposed to be a cloud based system accessed by farmers. Farmers will give soil features as input and the model will provide fertilizer predictions through an dashboard developed in MATLAB.  
-> Model includes automation for crop irrigation, smart ventilation and smart illumination based on environment variables from a closed system such as glasshouse.
